# About Me

I have always been a technology enthusiast, being the son of a technician, I was raised in contact with computers from an early age, I never stopped learning and studying about technology, thus being a perpetual student of the subject, every day I learn something new. I was a sound recording technician for 5 years, where I developed the ability to work and perform the best possible result together with the most diverse types of people.
